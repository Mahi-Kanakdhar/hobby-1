            <p>If you read, you can become great!<br>(FABULOUS!) I have read many books and they were great!<br> My favorite book is of 'JUST ADD MAGIC, JUST ADD MAGIC [MYSTERY CITY]'.<br> Personally, I like Hannah because she handles every situation, and I also like Kelly because she is very kind and she helps everyone who are cursed in the magic, one of her was Grandma. She was cursed and also Mama P (her grandma's friend). If you want to watch, you can watch the series and on the Amazon Prime Video or Youtube. But I would prefer the books (If you want to know I have also seen all the seasons of the series and books too!!!). You can also read the book. It is about the annoying Cookbook. If you read any book, it will take you to another world! No need to travel. You can go to the other world by sitting on a couch!<br> If you want to improve your English, you can go for: Just add Magic, Harry Potter. Harry Potter's book is also interesting. <br><br>I love coding! It is my favourite thing to do in life. Since I joind White hat jr coding classes I had a lot of fun learning it. So I got interested and started to learn more. I learnt and learnt until I made my first game. That's when I started to make more and had a lot of fun.
                Thank You! To my mother to buy books for me, also White hat... and my coding teacher to teach me new things, Javeria Firdous.
